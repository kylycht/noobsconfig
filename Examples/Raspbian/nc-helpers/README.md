NOOBSConfig - helper scripts
============================
This example provides a TAR file containing the helper scripts located and described in the Helpers folder.

Copying the files in this folder into the /os/Raspbian folder on your NOOBS recovery partition will install the helper scripts into the /usr/local/bin folder of your Raspbian installation, so that they can be used to help make other custom tarballs.
