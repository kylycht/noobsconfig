Noobsconfig - Examples
======================
The folders below here contain a few examples of how noobsconfig can be used to customise a distro during installation with NOOBS, grouped into distro folders.

The current examples focus on Raspbian, but I welcome other examples, particularly for the other distros.

After unzipping the noobsconfig.zip file over your noobs files, copy the examples files you want to use into the appropriate /os/distro folder in noobs according to the individual README.md files. If you want to use several customisations at once, you must merge the Raspbian_root.txt (or Raspbian_boot.txt) files together.
